# Hi there, I'm frozephoenix! 👋
 
I'm currently an electronics student with a growing passion for technology, both hardware and software.

I have a foundation in C programming and am always eager to learn more—whether it's about coding, electronics, or anything new and exciting!

I love exploring open source projects and communities and I'm inspired by the innovation and collaboration in the Linux and open source world.
  
Music is a big part of my life and helps fuel my creativity.
  
I'm curious by nature and always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether it's in electronics, software, or something completely new.
